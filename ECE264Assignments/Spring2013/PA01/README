This assignment asks you to compute several properties of an array of
integers.  

You should modify only the file answer01.c  

You can add additional functions in answer01.c.  

You can add new functions.  This is true for all assignments.

Some parts of the program have already been written for you and you
should not modify those parts.

This assignment includes many pieces of useful information and you
will learn these pieces in the coming weeks.  Do not worry if you do
not understand everything in the first week.  Focus on writing the
functions in answer01.c.  If you have taken the prerequisite CS 159, you
should have no problem filling the code for these functions.

If you need help, please visit the intructors' or the teaching
assistants' office hours.

=================================================================

This assignment asks you to 
* add all elements in an array of integers
* determine whether any element in the array is a negative number
* determine whether the elements' values are increasing

This program has the following files
pa01.h     a header file
pa01.c     a C file for main
answer01.c   a C file
inputgen.c a C file used to generate the test cases
Makefile   

You need to worry about answer01.c only.  You are certainly welcome to
read the other files.  Do not worry if you do not understand the other
files yet.  

To execute and to test your program, type

   	       make

in Linux terminal.  

You will receive the score of your program.

You can use 

    	    make -s

to print fewer messages.  

If you have not changed the program since that last time you type
make and you type make again, you will get this message

make: `pa01' is up to date.

Please type 

       	    make clean

then

	    make

================================================================

After you finish this program, upload answer01.c to Blackboard and
submit it.
