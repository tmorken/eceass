   If an array has length elements.  The valid indexes are between 0
   and length - 1, not between 1 and length.  array[length] will
   access an invalid memory location and possibly terminate the
   program abnormally.

   This function returns the sum of the elements.
   For example, if

   array[2] is 9
   and length is 3
   This function should return 3 + 11 + 9 = 23.

   If the array has no element (length is 0), the function returns 0.

   For example, if
