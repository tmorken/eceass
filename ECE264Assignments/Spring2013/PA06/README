In this assignment, you need to write README and submit it with your
program.

What to put inside README?

First of all, you must understand that you write README for yourself,
not for the teaching staff.  The teaching staff already know how to
write this program.

Write README explaining how to write this program.  You should write
README before writing your program.  Why?  You need to think carefully
about the problem and the solution before writing code.  Explain why
you write the program in this way.  Explain why you use one function
vs another (for example, should you use fgetc, fscanf, fgets, or
something else?).  How do you write the comparison function for qsort?

The students that received high scores in ECE 264 would likely tell
you that they wrote README and comments before they wrote code.  As a
general rule, if you rush to write code, you will spend much more
time.  The more time you spend on thinking and designing, the less
time you spend on coding and debugging.  

Treat gcc warnings seriously.  In most cases, the warnings are serious
problems. There were many cases when students thought, "I will make my
program work first and then I will worry about the warnings."  Their
programs did not work because they ignored the warnings. 

You can use README to document your progress.  For example, you can
write down 

I did ....  and it did not work.  Later, I found the solution should
be ...

Again, write README for youself, not for the teaching staff.  Use
README as an opportunity for learning.
