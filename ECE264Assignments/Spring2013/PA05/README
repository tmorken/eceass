This assignment will have you work with strings and pointers.  We ask
you to implement a number of string manipulation functions.  Many of
these functions are already available in the C standard library
(string.h); here we will create our own versions of these functions.
You are obviously NOT allowed to use the existing versions in your
implementing.  Instead, you must implement all the code yourself.

Please see the files pa05.h and answer05.c for the function prototypes
you will be asked to write.  Fill in answer05.c with your code and
submit only this file through Blackboard.

While string management often requires you to manage memory as well,
this is not necessary for the functions we ask you write here.  You
should not be required to create new memory, not even for temporary
storage.  If you find yourself using malloc(), strdup(), and/or
free(), you are not solving this problem in the easiest way possible.
We will not deduct points for the use of dynamic memory management,
but you are reponsible for any memory leaks you may introduce.

A NULL-terminated string contains '\0' as the end of the string.  You
do not need to worry about the characters (if any) after '\0'.

NOTE:
Type "make" to compile the source code.
Type "make grade -s" to run the grading script.
Type "make clean" to remove generated files.
