ECE 265 - SPRING 2013 - PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 7
------------------------------------------------------------------

In this assignment, you need to write README explaining how you
solve the problem.  You should write README and comments before
writing code.

INTRODUCTION
============

So far we have only looked at text files in this class, but most of
the realistic files in a filesystem are actually binary.  This means
that the data they contain is not necessarily restricted to the
alphanumeric characters you will find in a text file and which you can
edit in a text editor.  Examples of binary file formats include MP3,
DOC, JPG, and many other files that are not restricted to raw ASCII
text.  In this exercise, we will see how to write C programs that are
capable of reading and writing binary files.  We will study a specific
file format for image data called BMP that is commonly used in the
Windows operating system.  Most web browsers are also able to read and
display BMP files.


ASSIGNMENT
==========

Write a C program that reads an image from a binary BMP file on disk,
inverts all of the pixels, and saves the image as a new BMP file.


BACKGROUND: BMP IMAGE FILES
===========================

The BMP file format is one of the easier formats out there, but it
still has a lot of complex support for extensions, compression, and
various color models.  To make this exercise manageable, we are going
to be focusing exclusively on 24-bit uncompressed BMP files.  We have
provided a function called BMP_checkValid() that ensures that the file
you are trying to read fulfills these constraints.  Your code should
call BMP_checkValid() to ensure that this is the case.

In general, BMP files consist of a 54-byte header (defined in the file
bmp.h that we provide in the next section) followed by image data.
The header has the same format for all 24-bit BMP images, and contains
information about the size of the image, its dimensions, its color
model, and so on.  Immediately following the header is a large chunk
of bytes that contain the color values for the image, arranged in a
sequence of rows (in other words, the first values are for the first
row, then the second, then the third, etc).  Color values in 24-bit
BMP are represented by three bytes: one for red (0-255), one for green
(0-255), and one for blue (0-255).  These three bytes uniquely
represent a particular color for that particular pixel in the image.

In this assignment, we are not going to worry too much about the exact
contents and dimensions of the image since we are not going to try to
display it on the screen (there are other programs for this).
Instead, we are going to simply invert all of the bytes in the image
data part of the file, and then store it back on disk.  This is good
because BMP files have fancy ways of padding each row so that it is a
multiple of four.  Don't worry about this here: if we make sure to
read all of the bytes from the file into memory, invert those bytes,
and then save them back, we are sure that the output file is going to
be correct.  Inverting a byte "value" is simply the same as replacing
it doing "value=255-value".  If you think about it, for color this
will result in the complementary color being chosen (black becomes
white, etc).

Reading a BMP file consists of the following steps:

1. Open a binary file for reading.
2. Read the 54-byte header into memory.
3. Check that the data in the header is valid (use BMP_checkValid
   given in bmp.c).
4. Allocate space for the image data.
5. Read the image data (which is the file size minus the 54 bytes of
   the header).
6. Close the file.

Saving a BMP file is similar:

1. Open a binary file for writing
2. Write the 54-byte header into the file
3. Write the image data into the file (again, the file size from the
   header minus 54 bytes)
4. Close the file.

DO NOT MODIFY pa07.c. You can temporarily comment out some codes in
pa07.c, however, to test functionalities of individual functions.


SPECIFICATIONS
==============

* Note that the 54-btye header actually consists of a 14-byte pre-header, following 40-byte of the "real" header. Therefore it is correct when you run BMP_printHeader and see "header size: 40" instead of 54. 

* The source file (argv[1]) and the destination file (argv[2]) are
  command-line arguments.

* Your program should first read the source file from disk, then
  invert all of the pixels in the image in memory, and then save
  back the file to the disk using the destination filename as the
  new name.

* Loading image data should be done by reading the remainder of the
  contents of the file (header.size - sizeof(BMP_Header)) using
  fread. The image data will come directly after the BMP_Header data
  in the file.

* You have to use the function PrintBMPHeader( ) as specified inside
  bmp.c to print the header.

* Your BMP loading function does not need to work for all .bmp files
  (the BMP standard allows for compression, different bitdepths, and
  colormaps).  It need only work for 24-bit RGB images with no
  colormap.  If you want to try this with other images beyond the
  ones we provide below, make sure you save the .bmp file with RLE
  (compression) disabled and with 24-bit colorspace.

* Inverting an RGB color pixel consists of reading the byte as
  "value" for the pixel, and replacing it with "255 - value".  This
  should be done for all components (red, green, blue) for each
  pixel.

* Saving a BMP file is similar to loading it.  First write the
  BMP_Header you loaded using fwrite, and then iteratively write
  each pixel using fwrite after the header.

* Note! There exist freely available BMP file loaders and savers
  with C source code on the Internet. Copying from these is
  cheating!  You are supposed to write the code yourself and you are
  required to use the structures and functions in our bmp.h and
  bmp.c files, you may not change any of these.


WARNING
=======

You MAY NOT use anything like the following:

    int num_pixels = 0;
    ... /* find the number of pixels */
    int array[num_pixels]; 

You have to use malloc() and free().


COMPILING AND EXECUTING
=======================

Warning messages are often indications of errors. For this assignment,
you lose 0.1 point for each warning message. The command will generate
an executable file called "pa07."

To execute this program, type

  ./pa07 <srcfile.bmp> <dstfile.bmp>

The second argument (argv[1]) is the file to load and the third
argument (argv[2]) is the file to save to (will be created).


MEMORY MANAGEMENT
=================

Memory management (allocation and release) is an important part of ECE
264. You have to allocate enough memory to make your program work. You
have to allocate and release memory as needed. You are not allowed to
allocate a large piece of memory regardless of the input size. We will
restrict stack size to prevent that. You will receive a heavy penalty
(50%) if your program does not release all memory (i.e. memory
leak). We will use valgrind to check for memory leaks.


GRADING
=======

The maximum score for this exercise is 4.0 points.
