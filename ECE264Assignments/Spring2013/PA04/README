This assignment asks you to write a program that can process text
files.  For simplicity, we assume each line can have at most 80
characters, including the new line character '\n'.  This program has
three functions:

* count the occurrences of the 26 English letters. Ignore cases: 'A'
  and 'a' are treated as the same.

* detect and count strings in each line.  

* determine whether a file is a palindrome.  A palindrome is a word or
  a phrase that is the same regardless of reading from left to right
  or from right to left.  The following are examples of palindrome:

  level
  Civic
  A Nut for a  Jar of     Tuna

  The following are not palindromes:

  purdue 
  A    Nut is for a      Jar of            Tuna

  Consider only English letters and ignore numbers, punctuation marks,
  space, tab, and newline characters when the program determines
  whether the file is a palindrome.  Your program should ignore
  non-alphabet letters in the file.  However, you should treat an
  upper case letter and its lower case form as the same letter.
