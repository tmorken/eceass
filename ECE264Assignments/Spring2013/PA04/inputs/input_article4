The Purdue Boilermakers 

On October 26, 1891, a newspaper in Crawfordsville, Indiana, called
Purdue's football team the "Boiler Makers" when writing about their
trouncing of Wabash College. Lafayette newspapers soon picked up the
name, and in October 1892, The Purdue Exponent, Purdue's student
newspaper, gave it the stamp of approval. In the early days of Purdue
football, the team was called other names as well, including
"haymakers," "railsplitters," "sluggers," and "cornfield sailors."

Purdue's Mascot The Boilermaker Special is the official mascot train
of Purdue. The idea for the Special began with an article in The
Purdue Exponent by Isreal Silkowitz. The first train was presented on
September 11, 1940. Since then, the Special has chugged its way to
football games and around campus to help rally the Purdue spirit.

Including the first Boilermaker Special, Purdue has had five versions
of the mascot train through the years. The fifth version was dedicated
September 25, 1993.

A smaller version of the mascot, the Boilermaker Special IV, or X-tra
Special as it is nicknamed, also makes appearances at special events.

The Reamer Club serves as official caretaker of the Specials, taking
responsibility for appearance and maintenance.
