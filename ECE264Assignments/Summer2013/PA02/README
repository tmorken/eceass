This assignment asks you to write a program that can

* count the amounts of data stored in files
* allocate memory based on the amounts
* read the files and store the data in the allocated memory
* order the data by calling the qsort
* save the sorted data into files

The main function will read two lines at a time from filelist, one as
input, one as output, and detect if the input name contains "str". From
there it calls the two functions depend on if the input is a file with
strings or integers. The main function will run all the testcases in 
filelist(which is in the directory called "input"). If you want to test 
for a single case, you need to write your own test main function.

For a file storing strings, you can assume that the length of each
line does not exceed LINELENGTH.  However, your program does not know
the number of lines in a file. 
 
Type "make help" in terminal to see the further option you have when 
you compile the program. Read the Makefile to get better understanding
on each command. Use "man <command>" in terminal to read linux user 
command manual.

Don't forget to check memory leak.
